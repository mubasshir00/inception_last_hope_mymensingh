At each Apollo landing site, NASA's astronauts explored the moon and left behind some devices for research. We created a VR application that visualizes this passive seismic experiment data on the moon surface, where people can experience moonquakes from 1971 to 1976 in a virtual reality environment like real life. We retrieved and simulated the Apollo lunar seismic data. Users will experience VR moonquakes from NASA APIs, and a virtual wristwatch will display data. An interactive option to navigate between the moonquake experiences. People without VR sets can explore Moonquake with 3D models. Finally, our application impacts future generations' ability to learn & research about Moon.
