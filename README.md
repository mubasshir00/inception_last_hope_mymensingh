# VR Moonquake Game / Simulator


## HIGH-LEVEL PROJECT SUMMARY
At each Apollo landing site, NASA's astronauts explored the moon and left behind some devices for research. We created a VR application that visualizes this passive seismic experiment data on the moon surface, where people can experience moonquakes from 1971 to 1976 in a virtual reality environment like real life. We retrieved and simulated the Apollo lunar seismic data. Users will experience VR moonquakes from NASA APIs, and a virtual wristwatch will display data. An interactive option to navigate between the moonquake experiences. People without VR sets can explore Moonquake with 3D models. Finally, our application impacts future generations' ability to learn &amp; research about Moon.

## DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
When NASA explored the Moon, NASA’s Apollo astronauts left behind several instruments to collect geophysical data near each Apollo landing site. We used those data sets to find out the Passive Seismic Experiment through the VR Moonquake Game. A virtual wristwatch shows details of the moonquake by time, location(latitude and longitude), and the magnitude of the particular moonquake. In the meantime, a visualization of the moonquake will happen, which can be experienced by the vibration and other moonquake material with the actual magnitude fetched from NASA APIs. Not only that, the user can interact with the moon element. E.g A user can pick a stone from the moon and throw it. Someone can travel to the Moon by our VR Moonquake Map. 

Our application will make a long term impact towards future generations' ability to learn & research about the moon by growing interest in knowing the moon and moonquake better. 


## HOW IT WORKS:
Users will interact with the system through a web application. A user with a VR headset can access the VR app. The VR app functions with Process I/O, Load Data, Simulate Physics, and Scenario Playback for developing the VR environment of the moon. We use the Unity Engine with the Scene Editor module and Interaction Model for this. And the interaction module is based on the visualization module and controller module, which makes a VR environment of the moon's surface with a moonquake, where users can explore the moonquake in a virtual reality environment like real life.

## HACKATHON JOURNEY
I am thrilled to join an onsite hackathon after two years! It’s amazing to attend a physical hackathon after a long pandemic! I can’t describe enough how happy I am to witness the thrill and adrenaline rush during hackathons. Last year we participated NASA SPACE APPS 2021 online & achieved “1st Runner Up” Place from “Mymensingh City.” We were really excited to have the title. 

We are inspired from Artemis Mission! As it is the first step in the next era of human exploration. Thus we picked The challenge “Make a Moonquake Map”. Our challenge was really hard to plot the PSE Data.  The Passive Seismic Experiments (PSE) were performed at Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16. Apollo 11 functioned for only about 3 weeks. Stations 12, 14, 15 and 16 operated continuously since their deployment and functioned as a seismic network until September 1977, when all the remaining experiments were shut down. More than 13000 seismic events were cataloged using data from the mid-period instruments during the operation of the network (Nakamura et al. 1981).

We learned how to tackle a challenge within 48 hrs. We divided all our task between our team members. We felt the exciting fun of the real world! That helped to learn how to collaborate with a team. 

I want to thank BASIS for organizing this amazing hackathon in Bangladesh. Without them, we could not have attended this world wide hackathon. We hope to achieve Champions title for our beloved country , Bangladesh
